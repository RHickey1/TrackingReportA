# TrackingReportA
VBA Macro coded to help generate monthly reports when used on a specific file downloaded from payroll processing system.
This Macro was written to expedite creating monthly reports for 100+ clients.
It takes the raw report from our payroll processing site and formats the report 
to make it more digestible for our clients. Since the processing site also makes 
errors on the report which they are unable to fix at this time, this macro also 
accounts for and fixes the mistakes. The macro runs off the raw downloaded report 
and the user form that pops up when you start the macro. Based on the userâ€™s 
input, it will make appropriate changes. The code is dynamic enough to only run 
through the number of rows that the file currently has. This code has gone through 
many iterations by this point to account for changes in how my company wants the 
report to look to changes in the downloaded file from our data processor. Some 
information has been redacted to protect IP from me and my company.
